# UDPListener

Task:
Develop an OS-independent, self-hosted application that is able to receive messages over UDP protocol from multiple clients and stores them in a database. The sender's IP address and message text are stored in two related tables in a relational database of your choice. The application also has a Web API that allows you to receive saved messages selected by address and date range. The application is made using ASP.NET 6 and Entity Framework. Web methods metadata can be exposed through Swagger.
